#Design Concepts 

My overall concept here is to create something we can all relate to in a lot of ways. 
I like the simplicity of creating a singular stretch of canvas so to speak to display 
the information in a kind of minimalist approach. I wanted to explore the use of colorful and warm tones that
form the appearance of a beautiful day at an apartment complex. I also want to try to make the building brick
and bring out some of the detail with that. 

I hope to impact my users by creating a warm tone and fun little expererience surrounding this singular buidling. 
I think a lot of people can relate to that lifestyle and like to explore miniature worlds and communities. I thinkk
I'd like the user to scroll down the building floor by floor and absorb information as it comes up on the page.
Then finally reach the first floor where they can view other CSS Zen Garden designs.
